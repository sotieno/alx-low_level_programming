# C - Getting familiar with bit manipulation

Aim of project is manipulate bits using bitwise operators in C.

# The bitwise operators:

| Operator | Representation |
| -------- | ----------- |
|XOR| ^ |
|OR| | |
|AND| & |
|LEFT SHIFT| << |
|RIGHT SHIFT| >> |
|NOT| ~ |


**XOR operator - ^**

**OR operator - |**

**AND operator - &**

**LEFT SHIFT operator - <<**

**RIGHT SHIFT operator - >>**

**NOT operator - ~**
